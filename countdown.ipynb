    "### Rules and Objectives of the Countdown Numbers Game:\n",
    "##### 1. Objective:\n",
    "- The main goal is to reach a target number using arithmetic operations on a given set of numbers within a limited time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Number Selection:\n",
    "- Six numbers are chosen at random. These can include two sets of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and one set each of 25, 50, 75, and 100.\n",
    "- The numbers are selected randomly from these sets, resulting in a mix of small and large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Target Number:\n",
    "- A random target number is generated, ranging from 101 to 999.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.  Time Limit:\n",
    "- Contestants have 30 seconds to calculate the target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.  Allowed Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The four basic arithmetic operations can be used: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).\n",
    "- Each of the six numbers can be used at most once. However, if the same number appears twice among the six, each occurrence can be used.\n",
    "- Division and subtraction must result in whole, positive numbers. Fractions and negative numbers are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Scoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contestants score points based on how close they get to the target number.\n",
    "- Exact solutions earn more points, but getting within a certain range (within 5 of the target) can also earn points.\n",

    "### Computational Complexity of Countdown \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing the computational complexity of the Countdown numbers game involves understanding the computational resources (like time and space) required by algorithms to solve the game, as the size of the input grows. The input size can be considered as the number of available numbers and operations to reach the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Problem Overview:\n",
    "In Countdown, you have six numbers and a target number. The task is to use any of the six numbers with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target. Each number can be used at most once, and operations can be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Complexity Factors:\n",
    "**Number of Numbers:**  \n",
    "You have up to six numbers to choose from. \n",
    "**Arithmetic Operations:** \n",
    "Four operations can be applied in various combinations.\n",
    "**Permutations of Numbers:**\n",
    "Different sequences in which the numbers can be arranged.\n",
    "**Combining Operations with Numbers:** \n",
    "Each number can be combined with others using different operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Time Complexity:\n",
    "**Permutations:** The number of permutations of six numbers is 6! (factorial of 6).\n",
    "**Operation Combinations:** Each pair of numbers can be combined in 4 ways (add, subtract, multiply, divide).\n",
    "**Nested Combinations:** Since operations can be nested, this exponentially increases the combinations.\n",
    "**Brute-Force Approach:** In a brute-force method, you would try every possible combination of numbers and operations. This could lead to a complexity that is factorial in nature, potentially O(n!), where n is the number of numbers (6 in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Space Complexity:\n",
    "**Recursion Depth:** If a recursive approach is used, the space complexity can depend on the depth of the recursion tree.\n",
    "**Storage of Combinations:** Storing intermediate results or combinations can also take space, though this is generally less of a concern compared to time complexity in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Algorithmic Considerations:\n",
    "**Pruning:** Implementing efficient algorithms involves pruning unnecessary computations, like not pursuing a path that cannot possibly reach the target.\n",
    "**Dynamic Programming/Memoization:** Programming technique of storing previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Practical Implications:\n",
    "The computation may not reach the worst-case scenario due to the nature of the game:\n",
    "\n",
    "You don’t always need to use all six numbers.\n",
    "Practical limits on the game (eg., time limits) mean exhaustive searches are not always feasible or necessary."
