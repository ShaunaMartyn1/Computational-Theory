    "## Origins and Development\n",
    "Countdown is a British game show that has captivated audiences since its inception. It first aired on Channel 4 on November 2, 1982, making it the first program broadcast on the newly launched channel. The game was based on the French show \"Des chiffres et des lettres\" (Numbers and Letters), which was created by Armand Jammot and began airing in 1965. The format of Countdown was unique for its time, combining elements of wordplay with numerical puzzles, challenging contestants' linguistic and mathematical skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "The show's format involves two main parts: the letters game, where contestants build the longest word possible from a random selection of letters, and the numbers game, which is the focus of this report. The inclusion of both elements has made Countdown not only a test of arithmetic skill but also of vocabulary and linguistic agility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over the years, Countdown has seen several changes in its presentation and rules but has consistently maintained its core format. It has had various hosts and lexicographers who have become well-known figures in British pop culture. The show's enduring popularity can be attributed to its educational value, the mental agility it requires, and its appeal to a broad demographic, from schoolchildren to the elderly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Countdown's format has contributed to public interest in both word and number puzzles, allowinf for computational thinking and problem-solving skills among its audience. The show's structure encourages viewers to think algorithmically, especially during the numbers game, where players must quickly determine the most efficient path to the target number using a limited set of tools, mirroring the process of developing algorithms in computer science.\n"

    "### Rules and Objectives of the Countdown Numbers Game:\n",
    "##### 1. Objective:\n",
    "- The main goal is to reach a target number using arithmetic operations on a given set of numbers within a limited time frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Number Selection:\n",
    "- Six numbers are chosen at random. These can include two sets of numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive) and one set each of 25, 50, 75, and 100.\n",
    "- The numbers are selected randomly from these sets, resulting in a mix of small and large numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Target Number:\n",
    "- A random target number is generated, ranging from 101 to 999.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4.  Time Limit:\n",
    "- Contestants have 30 seconds to calculate the target number.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5.  Allowed Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The four basic arithmetic operations can be used: addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (×), and division (÷).\n",
    "- Each of the six numbers can be used at most once. However, if the same number appears twice among the six, each occurrence can be used.\n",
    "- Division and subtraction must result in whole, positive numbers. Fractions and negative numbers are not allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Scoring:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contestants score points based on how close they get to the target number.\n",
    "- Exact solutions earn more points, but getting within a certain range (within 5 of the target) can also earn points.\n"

    "### Common Strategies in the Countdown Numbers Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Players of the Countdown Numbers Game adopt various strategies to approach the challenges presented by the game. These strategies are essential for making the most out of the numbers given and reaching the target number within the time limit. Here are some common strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Balanced Number Selection:** Players often aim for a balanced selection of large and small numbers. Choosing at least one large number (25, 50, 75, or 100) and a variety of smaller numbers can provide more flexibility in reaching the target. This balance allows for a broader range of arithmetic operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prioritising Operations:** Depending on the target number and the numbers selected, players prioritise certain operations. For targets close to the numbers given, addition and subtraction might be more relevant. For higher targets, multiplication—and occasionally division—become crucial. Recognizing which operations will most likely lead you closer to the target is key.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Breakdown of Target Number:** A common approach is to break down the target number into components that are easier to achieve with the available numbers. For example, seeing the target number as a combination of two products or sums can simplify the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use of 'Friendly' Numbers:** Players often look for 'friendly' numbers within their selection—numbers that easily work together, such as 2 and 50 for easy multiplication or numbers that add up to 10 or 100. These combinations can simplify calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Expert Techniques\n",
    "Advanced players or champions of the Countdown Numbers Game employ more sophisticated techniques, which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pattern Recognition**: Expert players are adept at recognising patterns within the numbers and the target. This can involve identifying potential combinations quickly or seeing a pathway to the target number based on previous experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memorisation of Number Combinations:** Some players memorize key number combinations that frequently appear useful in the game. Knowing the results of certain multiplications, additions, or ways to quickly reach numbers like 100 or 1000 can save precious time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced RPN Application:** Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) can significantly streamline the calculation process. Experts might use RPN to efficiently plan and execute a series of operations that lead to the target number. By organising their thoughts in RPN, they can reduce the mental load of keeping track of operation precedence and brackets.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategic Use of Operations:** Beyond prioritising operations, experts have a nuanced understanding of when and how to use each operation most effectively. This might involve choosing operations that allow for reversible steps or using multiplication and division early to avoid running out of useful numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Flexibility and Adaptation:** High-level players are also highly adaptable, able to change their strategy based on the numbers and target they're presented with. This flexibility allows them to explore different avenues quickly, abandoning less promising paths without hesitation."

    "### Computational Complexity of Countdown \n",
    "\n",
    "Analysing the computational complexity of the Countdown numbers game involves understanding the computational resources (like time and space) required by algorithms to solve the game, as the size of the input grows. The input size can be considered as the number of available numbers and operations to reach the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Problem Overview:\n",
    "In Countdown, you have six numbers and a target number. The task is to use any of the six numbers with arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to reach the target. Each number can be used at most once, and operations can be repeated.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Complexity Factors:\n",
    "- **Number of Numbers:** \n",
    "  - You have up to six numbers to choose from. \n",
    "- **Arithmetic Operations:** \n",
    "  - Four operations can be applied in various combinations.\n",
    "- **Permutations of Numbers:**\n",
    "  - Different sequences in which the numbers can be arranged.\n",
    "- **Combining Operations with Numbers:** \n",
    "  - Each number can be combined with others using different operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Time Complexity:\n",
    "- **Permutations:** \n",
    "    - The number of permutations of six numbers is 6!(factorial of 6) which is 720 possible outcomes.\n",
    "- **Operation Combinations:** \n",
    "    - Each pair of numbers can be combined in 4 ways (add, subtract, multiply, divide).\n",
    "- **Nested Combinations:** \n",
    "    - Since operations can be nested, this exponentially increases the combinations.\n",
    "- **Brute-Force Approach:** \n",
    "    - In a brute-force method, you would try every possible combination of numbers and operations. This could lead to a complexity that is factorial in nature, potentially O(n!), where n is the number of numbers (6 in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Space Complexity:\n",
    "- **Recursion Depth:** \n",
    "    - If a recursive approach is used, the space complexity can depend on the depth of the recursion tree.\n",
    "- **Storage of Combinations:** \n",
    "    - Storing intermediate results or combinations can also take space, though this is generally less of a concern compared to time complexity in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Algorithmic Considerations:\n",
    "- **Pruning:** \n",
    "    - Implementing efficient algorithms involves pruning unnecessary computations, like not pursuing a path that cannot possibly reach the target.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Programming/Memoisation:** \n",
    "    - Programming technique of storing previously computed results to avoid redundant calculations. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### 6. Computational\n",
    "- **NP-Class Consideration:** \n",
    "    - The problem is in NP, as verifying a given solution is polynomially tractable.\n",
    "- **NP-Completeness Potential:** \n",
    "    - While not formally proven, the problem's combinatorial nature and its similarity to known NP-complete problems such as Subset Sum suggest it might be NP-complete. \n",
    "    - This perspective is crucial for understanding the inherent difficulty of the problem and why certain algorithms may perform better than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 7. Practical Implications:\n",
    "- **Use of Numbers:** \n",
    "    - Not all numbers must be used, this allows for flexibility in strategy.\n",
    "- **Game Constraints:**\n",
    "    - Time constraints within the game limit the feasibility of exhaustive searches, emphasising the need for efficient algorithmic solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Best, Worst and Average Case Scenarios:\n",
    "- **Best Case:** \n",
    "    - The target number can be directly reached or closely approximated with minimal operations, such as when it is a multiple or near-multiple of one or more of the available numbers. \n",
    "- **Worst Case:** \n",
    "    - The target number requires a complex combination of all numbers with nested operations, maximising the use of computational resources.\n",
    "- **Average Case:** \n",
    "    - Typically involves using a moderate number of operations and possibly combining multiple numbers, representing the most common scenario encountered by players.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Big O Notation Analysis\n",
    "Big O notation provides a high-level understanding of the algorithm in terms of its time and space complexity. Here we consider how these complexities scale with respect to the input size, specifically the number of available numbers and permissible operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Permutations and Combinations:** The time complexity for generating all permutations of the six numbers is \\(O(6!)\\). For each permutation, we consider combinations with operations. Since four operations can be applied between any two numbers, and operations can be nested, the complexity for generating all possible combinations of operations applied to a single permutation is \\(O(4^6)\\), where 4 represents the number of operations and 6 represents potential places in the permutation to apply these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall Time Complexity:** Combining permutations and operations, the worst-case time complexity can be approximated as \\(O(6! \\times 4^6)\\). This reflects the factorial growth due to permutations compounded by exponential growth due to operation combinations. This complexity indicates that a brute-force approach is impractical for larger sets of numbers or operations, as the time to solve increases super-exponentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Space Complexity Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recursion Stack:** If a recursive approach is utilized to implement the solution, the maximum depth of the recursion stack would be proportional to the number of numbers, which is 6. Thus, the space complexity can be approximated as \\(O(6)\\), reflecting the depth of recursive calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memoisation Storage:** If memoisation is used to store intermediate results (dynamic programming approach), the space required will depend on the number of distinct states that can be generated during the computation. This space is typically bounded by the number of permutations of numbers and possible results at each step, leading to a complexity of \\(O(6! \\times \\text{range\\_of\\_intermediate\\_results})\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithmic Implications with Big O Notation:**\n",
    "- **Practical Implications:** Given the exponential time complexity, practical solutions must leverage algorithmic strategies that reduce the need to explore every combination. Pruning invalid or suboptimal paths early in the computation and using memoization to avoid recalculating known results are crucial for enhancing performance.\n",
    "- **NP-Hard Consideration:** The factorial and exponential components of the complexity suggest that the problem is NP-hard, meaning that it is computationally challenging to find an exact solution rapidly as the input size grows. This is aligned with its similarity to the Subset Sum problem, which is a well-known NP-complete problem.\n"

    "\n",
    "## Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and Its Application in the Countdown Numbers Game\n",
    "\n",
    "Reverse Polish Notation, also known as as postfic notation, is a mathematical notation in which every operator follows all of its operands. It is a linear representation of mathematical expressions without the need for parentheses to denote operation precedence. RPN makes it easier to input and evaluate mathematical expressions for both humans and computers. In the context of the Countdown Numbers Game, RPN can be particularly useful in simplifying the computational process of finding solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application in Countdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Countdown Numbers Game, players aim to reach a target number by using a set of given numbers and arithmetic operations. The challenge lies in figuring out the correct sequence of operations and number combinations. RPN can streamline this process by providing a clear and efficient way to structure these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Elimination of Ambiguity:\n",
    "Traditional infix notation can lead to ambiguity without parentheses, requiring a clear understanding of operation precedence (e.g., multiplication before addition). RPN naturally eliminates this ambiguity, as the order of operations is explicitly defined by the notation sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. Simplified Computation:\n",
    "RPN enables simpler and faster computation, particularly beneficial under the game's time constraints. Computers can evaluate RPN expressions more efficiently because they don't have to deal with operation precedence or parentheses, reducing the computational overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Algorithmic Efficiency:\n",
    "Implementing algorithms to solve Countdown puzzles can benefit from RPN by reducing the complexity of parsing expressions. Algorithms can directly process RPN expressions in a linear fashion, using a stack-based approach for evaluation. This allows for more straightforward implementation of solution-finding algorithms, potentially improving both time and space efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Enhanced Solution Search:\n",
    "When searching for solutions to reach the target number, RPN can facilitate the generation and evaluation of possible number-operation sequences. This can be particularly advantageous when employing techniques like pruning or memoization, as RPN provides a more streamlined form of expression that can be easily manipulated and evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical Implementation:\n",
    "The practical implementation of RPN in solving the Countdown puzzle involves generating potential RPN sequences that represent valid operations on the given numbers.\n",
    "A stack can be used to evaluate these sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation:** Produce potential RPN sequences by interspersing the given numbers with the allowable operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), ensuring that each operation has the necessary number of operands available in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evaluation:** Use a stack to evaluate each RPN sequence. Push numbers onto the stack, and upon encountering an operation, pop the required operands from the stack, perform the operation, and push the result back onto the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "The practical implementation of RPN in solving the Countdown puzzle involves generating potential RPN sequences that represent valid operations on the given numbers. A stack can be used to evaluate these sequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generation:** Produce potential RPN sequences by interspersing the given numbers with the allowable operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division), ensuring that each operation has the requisite number of operands available in the stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation and Optimisation:** Ensure that during the evaluation, the operations are valid (e.g., no division by zero, no negative results from subtraction) and aim to optimise the search for sequences that approach or match the target number.\n"

    "### Genetic Algorithm Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Break down of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Basic Operations:** This code defines the 4 basic arithmetic operations, addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. \n",
    "An array of these operations is created this array will be used to randomly select operations when generating individual solutions. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Initial Population:** The generate_individual function creates a single individual or solution for the puzzle. An individual consists of a sequence of numbers and operations. The numbers are randomly shuffled, and an operation is randomly chosen for each pair of numbers. The individual is represented as a list of tuples, with each tuple containing a number and an operation (except the last number, which is paired with None).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fitness Function:** The evaluate function calculates how close an individual solution is to the target number. It applies the operations sequentially to the numbers in the individual and compares the result to the target number. The fitness score is the absolute difference between the individual's result and the tagte number. A lower score indicates a better solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evolution Process:** The evolve function simulates the evolutionary process. It takes the top 10 fittest individuals from the current population. Then it generates a new generation of individuals by combining parts of these fittest individuals(crossover) and occasionally altering a part (mutation). This process is intended to explore a wide variety of solutions while also improving on the best solutions so far.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Crossover:** During the evolutionary phase, a child individual is formed by randomly choosing two parents from the top performers and combining the first half from one parent with the second half from the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Mutation:** With a small probability, the child undergoes a mutation where either a randomly chosen number is replaced with another number from the original set or an operation is switched to a different one. This step introduces variation and helps prevent the algorithm from getting stuck in local optima(solutions that are better than their immediate neighbours but not the best possible overall solution).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Main Loop:** The population evolves over 100 generations(iterations), with the idea that the solutions will progressively improve.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Result:** After the evolutionary process, the best individual in the final population is considered the best solution found by the algorithm. The individual is the closest solution to the target number that the algorithm could find.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is trying to find the best combination of the given numbers and operations to reach or get as close as possible to the target number. The genetic algorithm approach is beneficial for this kind of problem because it can efficiently search through a best space of possible solutions, improving upon them iteratively in a way that mimics natural evolution.\n",

    "The Monte Carlo method relies on random sampling to estimate solutions to problems. In the context of the Countdown Numbers Game, where players must reach a target number using a specific set of numbers and arithmetic operations, Monte Carlo methods can be used to generate a large number of random solutions. By repeatedly sampling different combinations of numbers and operations, this method can estimate the probability of reaching the target number or getting close to it.\n",
    "Monte Carlo methods are particularly useful when deterministic algorithms (like brute-force or dynamic programming) become computationally prohibitive. This could be due to a high target number or complex combinations of numbers where traditional methods might take too long to compute a solution. Additionally, when the game's constraints make traditional search and optimisation algorithms inefficient or when a quick, approximate answer is more valuable than an exact solution, Monte Carlo methods work as they can provide a statistically significant estimate of solution feasibility.\n",

    "1. Brute Force Algorithms\n",
    "2. Constraint Programming\n",
    "3. Heuristic Searches\n",
    "4. Dynamic Programming/Memoisation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brute Force Algorithms\n",
    "A brute force algorithm attempts every possible combination of operations and numbers to reach the target number. This approach guarantees finding a solution if it exists but is computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Brute Force Algorithms in Countdown:\n",
    "Given the limited number of numbers (six) and operations (four), a brute force method is feasible but not efficient. For each selection of numbers, there are factorial permutations, and each permutation can be combined with multiple sequences of operations.\n",
    "It is simple to implement and guaranteed to find a solution if one exists. However, it is highly inefficient, especially as the number of elements increases. The will be exponential growth in computational time with the addition of more numbers or operations. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contraint Programming:\n",
    "Constraint programming involves defining a problem in terms of constraints and variables and using constraint solvers to find feasible solutions. It excels in solving problems where relationships between variables can be specified as constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Contraint Programming in Countdown:\n",
    "In the Countdown Numbers Game, constraints can be set on the use of each number, ensuring it is used at most once, and on operations to yield integer results. A constraint solver can then be used to explore feasible solutions without violating these constraints.\n",
    "It can be effiecint for problems with well-defined constraints. Reduces the search space significantly by pruning pathst that voilate contraints.It can quicly find solutions or prove the absence of solutions within specific bounds. However, it requires a thorigh understanding of constraint programming and access to robust constraint solver software. It may not be intuitive as more straightforward algorithmic approches. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heuristic Searches:\n",
    "Heuristic searches use techniques to intelligently guess the solution by using a heuristic function to guide the search. Common heuristic methods include genetic algorithms and simulated annealing, which simulate natural processes to explore solution spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Heuristic Searches in Countdown:\n",
    "For the Countdown game, a heuristic might evaluate the closeness of a computational result to the target number, directing the search toward more promising areas of the solution space.It is more efficient than brute force as it does not require examining all possibilities. It can quickly find good (though not necessarily optimal) solutions. It is adaptable to various problem types by changing the heuristic function. However, it does not guarantee finding the optimal solution and the effectiveness depends heavily on the quality of the heuristic used. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Programming/Memoisation:\n",
    "Dynamic programming breaks down a problem into simpler subproblems and solves each subproblem only once, storing the solution to avoid redundant calculations. This technique is closely related to memoisation, which specifically involves caching the results of expensive function calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dynamic Programming/Memoisation in Countdown:\n",
    "This approach can be effective for the Countdown game by solving for smaller target numbers with subsets of the available numbers and building up to the final target. Memoization can help avoid recalculating results for the same sub-targets with the same numbers. It reduces redundant calculations, saving time and ensures all subproblems are solved optimally, leading to an optimal solution for the main problem if correctly applied. However, it requires additional memory to store intermediate results. Also the  setup can be complex, especially for problems with many variables.\n",

    "- **Time Complexity:** O(n!) due to the factorial number of permutations of numbers and the combinations of operations applied to these permutations.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** Relatively low unless keeping track of all combinations tried; primarily requires memory proportional to the recursion depth.\n",
    "- **Practical Usage:** Suitable for smaller sets of numbers or when accuracy and certainty (finding an exact solution if one exists) are paramount. However, its inefficiency grows exponentially with the number of numbers and operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraint Programming:**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** Potentially high, but generally more efficient than brute-force because it avoids exploring obviously infeasible solutions by applying constraints.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** Can be higher than brute force due to the storage of state information about constraints and variables.\n",
    "- **Practical Usage:** More efficient for larger datasets or when the game’s rules can be tightly defined as constraints. Ideal when operations and number usage must follow strict rules, reducing unnecessary computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristic Searches:**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** Variable, often better than brute force. The complexity depends on the heuristic's ability to prune the search space effectively.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** Generally low, similar to brute force, unless storing paths or states extensively.\n",
    "- **Practical Usage:** Useful when solutions need to be good enough rather than optimal, or when the solution space is vast and complex. Allows flexibility and adaptation to various problem types, especially with variable targets and numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dynamic Programming/Memoisation:**\n",
    "- **Time Complexity:** Can be significantly reduced compared to brute force by avoiding the re-computation of results for the same subproblems.\n",
    "- **Space Complexity:** Higher due to the need for storing results of subproblems, which could grow with the complexity and number of sub-target calculations.\n",
    "- **Practical Usage:** Highly effective when the problem involves overlapping subproblems, such as recurring calculations with subsets of numbers. Ideal for situations where calculations may be repeated many times with different initial conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Summary:\n",
    "While the brute-force method is straightforward and guarantees finding a solution, its practical application is limited by exponential growth in time complexity with additional numbers or operations. In contrast, constraint programming and heuristic searches offer more scalable solutions under specific conditions, such as well-defined constraints or acceptable approximate solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dynamic programming/memoisation stands out for problems characterized by overlapping subproblems, offering an optimal blend of efficiency and comprehensiveness by caching results and reducing redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the Countdown Numbers Game, selecting between these methods depends on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The size of the number set and the range of the target number.\n",
    "- The acceptable margin for error or approximation in the solution.\n",
    "- The computational resources available and the time constraints of the game scenario.\n",

    "## Rationale Behind the Chosen Approach for the solve_numbers Function\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview of the solve_numbers Function**\n",
    "The solve_numbers function was designed to tackle the Countdown numbers game by finding a solution that reaches or comes close to a given target number using a specific set of six numbers and the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The function aims to return at least one solution if it exists, or None if no exact solution can be found. This approach was selected based on several key factors including the complexity of the problem, the computational efficiency, and the practical constraints of the game such as time limits and the use of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decision Factors**\n",
    "1. **Computational Feasibility:** The Countdown numbers game, by its nature, presents a combinatorial problem where the number of possible operations grows exponentially with the number of numbers and operations used. A direct brute-force approach would involve evaluating the results of every possible combination of operations and numbers, which is computationally expensive and inefficient. Therefore, a more sophisticated method was necessary to make the problem tractable within the typical constraints of runtime performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Game Constraints:** The rules of the Countdown game impose specific constraints:\n",
    "- Each of the six numbers can be used only once.\n",
    "- Division and subtraction must result in whole, positive numbers.\n",
    "These rules eliminate a vast number of potential operations, requiring an approach that can dynamically adapt to the legality of operations during the computation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Practical Efficiency:** Given the real-world application of the function in a game scenario where solutions need to be computed within a short time frame (30 seconds), the chosen approach needed to balance accuracy with computational speed. This balance ensures that the function can operate effectively under the tight time constraints typical of the game setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Chosen Strategy: Recursive Search with Pruning\n",
    "The solve_numbers function implements a recursive search strategy combined with pruning to efficiently explore possible solutions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Recursive Search:** This method explores different arithmetic operations recursively, building potential solutions step-by-step. It starts with one of the six numbers and recursively applies operations with the remaining numbers, checking if the target can be achieved or approached closely.\n",
    "- **Pruning:** During the recursive search, any path that violates the game's rules (e.g., division that does not result in a whole number, or subtraction leading to negative results) is immediately pruned from the search space. This pruning significantly reduces the number of computations by eliminating impossible or illegal solutions early in the search process.\n",
    "- **Memorisation:** To further enhance performance, the function incorporates memorisation to avoid redundant calculations. This technique stores the results of previous computations and reuses them when the same computation is needed again, thus speeding up the overall process by reducing unnecessary recalculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Justification of the Approach**\n",
    "This approach is justified as it efficiently handles the game's constraints and exploits the characteristics of the problem space. By focusing computational resources on viable paths and eliminating impossible ones early through pruning, the function can operate within the strict time limits of the game while maximizing the chances of finding a solution or a close approximation. The recursive nature paired with memorization also allows the function to explore the problem space thoroughly but efficiently, ensuring that all potential solutions are considered without unnecessary duplication of effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "The solve_numbers function represents a balanced approach to solving the Countdown numbers game by effectively addressing the computational challenges and adhering to the game's rules. This method demonstrates a practical application of algorithmic design principles such as recursion, pruning, and memorisation, which are crucial for solving complex combinatorial problems efficiently. By choosing this strategy, the implementation ensures that the function is both effective in finding solutions and efficient in terms of computational resources, making it well-suited for real-world game settings.\n",

    "1. **Define the 'solve_numbers' functions**\n",
    "- The solve_numbers funciton takes 'numbers' (a list of ints) and a 'target' (an int) as inputs. \n",
    "2. **Define the Helper Functions and Variables**\n",
    "- 'operations' and 'op_symbols' are defined to map the arithmetic functions to their corresponding symbols for building the expression strings. \n",
    "3. **Purpose:** To explore all combinations of operations for a given permutation of numbers.\n",
    "- **Parameters:** It takes current_value (the cumulative result of previous operations), index (the current position in the number list), and expression (the mathematical expression built so far).\n",
    "- **Base Case:** If the index is equal to the length of the numbers list, it checks if current_value equals the target. If so, it returns the expression.\n",
    "- **Recursive Case:**\n",
    "- - For each operation, it attempts to apply it to current_value and the next number in the list.\n",
    "- - It checks for valid operations (e.g., no division by zero, no negative results from subtraction).\n",
    "- - If the operation is valid, it updates current_value and expression, then recursively calls itself with the new values.\n",
    "- - If a recursive call returns a non-None result, it indicates a solution has been found, and this result is propagated back up the call stack.\n",
    "4. **Permutations Loop:**\n",
    "- The function iterates over all permutations of the numbers list. For each permutation, it starts the recursive exploration with the first number of the permutation as the initial current_value, the second position as the initial index, and the first number converted to a string as the initial expression.\n",
    "5. **Result Handling:**\n",
    "- If a valid expression that achieves the target is found during the exploration of permutations and operations, it is returned as the solution.\n",
    "- If no valid solution is found after all permutations and operations have been tried, the function returns None.\n",
    "6. **Output:**\n",
    "- The solution (if found) or a message indicating no solution is found is printed.\n"
